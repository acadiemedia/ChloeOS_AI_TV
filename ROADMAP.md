## ChloeOS TV Roadmap

**Phase 1: Core System Stabilization & Content Integration (Current - Next 1-2 Months)**

*   **Objective:** Ensure the merged `ChloeOS_AI_TV` repository is fully functional and serves as the stable foundation for all operations.
*   **Key Initiatives:**
    *   **Verify Merged Content:** Thoroughly test that all content (scripts, visuals, audio, metadata) from the former `chloe-tv-content` repository is correctly integrated and accessible within `ChloeOS_AI_TV`.
    *   **Automated Content Ingestion:** Develop and refine robust mechanisms for LLMs (Codex, Gemini) to generate, curate, and automatically ingest new content into the `content/` directory.
    *   **OBS Automation Refinement:** Optimize existing OBS Studio automation scripts (Lua/Python) for seamless scene transitions, media playback, and dynamic content updates.
    *   **Error Handling & Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging and error reporting for all components (content generation, OBS automation, streaming) to quickly identify and resolve issues.
    *   **Basic Live Stream Monitoring:** Set up basic monitoring for the live stream health and uptime.

**Phase 2: Enhanced Autonomy & Interactivity (Next 3-6 Months)**

*   **Objective:** Increase the autonomy of ChloeOS TV and introduce initial forms of viewer interaction.
*   **Key Initiatives:**
    *   **Advanced Scheduling & Rotation:** Implement more sophisticated scheduling algorithms for content rotation, ensuring variety and adherence to the noon/midnight pulse.
    *   **Submission Processing Automation:** Fully automate the processing and integration of content from the `content/submissions/` directory, including AI review and merging into storylines.
    *   **Viewer Interaction Module:** Develop initial features for viewer interaction (e.g., chat integration, polls, simple command processing) that can influence content or stream flow.
    *   **Dynamic Visuals & Audio:** Explore and implement methods for dynamically generating or modifying visuals and audio based on real-time data or AI decisions.
    *   **LLM Integration Optimization:** Improve the efficiency and quality of content generation from Codex and Gemini, potentially integrating more advanced prompt engineering or fine-tuning.

**Phase 3: Expansion & Personalization (Next 6-12 Months)**

*   **Objective:** Expand the reach and capabilities of ChloeOS TV, introducing personalization and more complex AI-driven narratives.
*   **Key Initiatives:**
    *   **Multi-Platform Streaming:** Extend streaming capabilities to additional platforms beyond the current setup.
    *   **Personalized Content Streams:** Develop features for personalized content delivery or alternative stream versions based on viewer preferences or demographics.
    *   **Complex Narrative Generation:** Enable the AI to generate more intricate and evolving storylines, potentially spanning multiple episodes or themes.
    *   **Advanced AI-Driven Moderation:** Implement AI-powered moderation for viewer interactions and content submissions.
    *   **Scalability & Performance:** Optimize the entire system for increased scalability and performance to handle a larger audience and more complex operations.
    *   **External API Integrations:** Integrate with external APIs for real-time data, news, or other dynamic content sources to enrich the stream.
